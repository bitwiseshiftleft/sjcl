  <h1>Stanford Javascript Crypto Library</h1>

  <div id="main">

  <p>The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library
  (hosted <a href="http://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/">here</a>
  on GitHub) is a project by the Stanford Computer Security Lab to
  build a secure, powerful, fast, small, easy-to-use, cross-browser
  library for cryptography in Javascript.</p>

  <p>SJCL is easy to use: simply run <code>sjcl.encrypt("password",
  "data")</code> to encrypt data, or <code>sjcl.decrypt("password",
  "encrypted-data")</code> to decrypt it.  For users with more complex
  security requirements, there is a much more powerful API, described
  in the <a href="doc/">documentation</a> and illustrated in
  this <a href="demo/">demo page</a>.</p>

  <p>SJCL is small but powerful.  The
  <a href="sjcl.js">minified version</a> of the library is under 6.4KB
  compressed, and yet it posts impressive speed results.  (TODO: put
  up a benchmarks page.)</p>

  <p>SJCL is secure.  It uses the industry-standard AES algorithm at
  128, 192 or 256 bits; the SHA256 hash function; the HMAC
  authentication code; the PBKDF2 password strengthener; and the CCM
  and OCB authenticated-encryption modes.  Just as importantly, the
  default parameters are sensible: SJCL strengthens your passwords by
  a factor of 1000 and salts them to protect against rainbow tables,
  and it authenticates every message it sends to prevent it from being
  modified.  We believe that SJCL provides the best security which is
  practically available in Javascript.  (Unfortunately, this is not as
  great as in desktop applications because it is not feasible to
  completely protect against code injection, malicious servers and
  side-channel attacks.)</p>

  <p>SJCL is cross-browser.  We hope.  We've tested it on all the
  install browsers on the security lab computers (including various
  versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera on
  Mac, Linux and Windows) and on the rhino engine, but still need to
  do more comprehensive testing.  We have a <a href="browserTest/">test
  page</a> up on this site; if it reports any failures,
  please <a href="http://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/issues">report
  an issue</a>.</p>

  <p>SJCL is open.  You can use, modify and redistribute it under a
  BSD license or under the GNU GPL, version 2.0 or higher.</p>

  <p>SJCL also supports elliptic curve cryptography (ECDH public key encryption and ECDSA signatures). If you want to use it, you will have to compile your own version of sjcl.js</p>

  <p>SJCL was written by Emily Stark, Mike Hamburg and Dan Boneh at
  Stanford University.  Special thanks to Aldo Cortesi and Roy
  Nicholson for reporting bugs in earlier versions of SJCL.
  A <a href="acsac.pdf">whitepaper</a> on SJCL (also by Emily Stark,
  Mike Hamburg and Dan Boneh) was published in the
  2009 <a href="http://www.acsac.org">Annual Computer Security
  Applications Conference</a>.</p>
